# Factor-Analytic-Inference-Model
My Master's thesis research code + additional research for the SAND workshop presentation.

A direct comparison of Gaussian and Poisson Factor Analytic Models for spike-train based Neuroscience research. This code is the backbone of the projcet, using a new Variational Inference (VI) model to decode visual cortex spike trains with a Poisson distributed loss function. This inference model is required as traditional expectation maximization (code provided in a seperate script in this repository) only works on Gaussian distributed data. VI model can be modified to decode Gaussian data with a statistically normal loss function. 

SAND changes: Model and comparison inmprovements. Still undergoing!

Graphing and figure construction was conducted in Google Colab notebooks.
